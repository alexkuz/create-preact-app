# Create React App

Create Preact apps with no build configuration.

This is a fork of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## tl;dr

```sh
npm install -g create-preact-app

create-preact-app my-app
cd my-app/
npm start

```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.<br>
When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.
